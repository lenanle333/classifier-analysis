## Description
The Noisy Classifier Evaluation repository is a collection of tools and utilities for evaluating the performance of machine learning classifiers in the presence of noisy data. Noise in the training data can have a significant impact on the accuracy and robustness of classifiers, and understanding their behavior in such scenarios is crucial for real-world applications.

This repository provides a set of evaluation metrics, datasets, and analysis scripts to assess the performance of classifiers under various levels and types of noise. By using this toolkit, you can gain insights into the noise tolerance of different classifiers and make informed decisions about their suitability for specific tasks or domains.
